\section{Test case to assess the implementation of the overturner model} \label{app:test_case}
Two test cases adapted from \textit{Eric Deleersnijder}'s working paper \cite{deleersnijder2011test} are presented here: after introducing the problems, the analytic solutions are computed as well as their main properties. The code is then run on those problems, and the numerical solution and its properties are compared to the analytical ones. Rather than a validation of the numerical solver, this can be considered as a \textit{sanity check}.

%----------------------------------GOVERNING EQUATIONS--------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{Governing equations}
Let us consider a water domain, whose width is denoted $B(\b{x},t)$, where $\b{x} = (y,z)$ is the position vector and $t$ is the time. The continuity equation is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:testcase:continuity}
	\frac{\partial B}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (B\b{u}) = 0,
\end{equation}
where $\b{u}(t,\b{x})$ is the latitudinally-averaged meridional velocity. Assuming that mixing along the parallels is sufficiently efficient, we may study the concentration of a passive tracer by means of a two-dimensional model. The latitudinally-averaged concentration of the tracer $C(\b x, t)$ obeys the following partial differential equation :
\begin{equation} \label{eq:testcase:conservative}
	\frac{\partial (BC)}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (B \b{u} C) = Q\delta(\b{x} - \b{x}_1) + \nabla \cdot (B\b{K} \cdot \nabla C), 
\end{equation}
where $\b{K}$ is the diffusivity tensor (symmetric and positive definite); $\delta$ is the Dirac delta function with $\delta(\b{x}-\b{x}_n) = \delta(x-x_n)\delta(y-y_n)$; $Q(t)$ is the rate of release of a lineic source of length $B$ along the latitude direction located at $\b{x} = \b{x}_1$. If $C(\b x,t)$ represents the 
density of the tracer in water, then $Q(t)$ is the mass of tracer released per second by the source.

Equation \eqref{eq:testcase:conservative} is the so-called conservative form of the model. The convective form is obtained by combining equations \eqref{eq:testcase:continuity} and \eqref{eq:testcase:conservative}:
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:testcase:convective}
	\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + \b{u} \cdot \nabla C = \frac{Q}{B} \delta(\b{x} - \b{x}_1) + \frac{1}{B} \nabla \cdot (B\b{K} \cdot \nabla C).
\end{equation}

%----------------------------------AN IDEALISED MODEL----------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{An idealized model}
For our test case to be interesting, we must be able to compute its analytical solution. Accordingly, we make some simplifying assumptions which will allow us to compute the solution analytically.
First, we assume a constant width $B$ and a constant velocity field
\begin{equation} \label{eq:testcase:velocity}
	\b{u}(t,\b{x}) = v \b e_y + w \b e_z,
\end{equation}
where $\b e_y$ and $\b e_z$ are the unit vectors associated respectively with the $y$- and $z$-coordinate axis. Furthermore, the diffusivity tensor is supposed constant and diagonal :
\begin{equation} \label{eq:testcase:diffusivity}
	\b{K} = \begin{pmatrix}
			K_{yy} & 0 \\
			0 & K_{zz}
			\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
where $K_{yy},\ K_{zz} > 0$. Finally, we consider a sudden pointwise release of tracer at $t=0$. Hence, $Q(t)$ is of the form :
\begin{equation}
	Q(t) = M\delta(t),
\end{equation} 
where $M$ is the mass of tracer released at $t=0$.

Under these assumptions, equation \eqref{eq:testcase:convective} simplifies to :
\begin{equation} \label{eq:testcase}
	\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + v \frac{\partial C}{\partial y} + w \frac{\partial C}{\partial z} = J \delta(t) \delta(y - y_1)\delta(z-z_1) + K_{yy} \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial y^2} + K_{zz} \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial z^2},
\end{equation}
where $J := M/B$.
For the sake of simplicity, we can forget about the fact that our model is width-integrated and consider that it is a purely two-dimensional model with a point-source
\begin{equation}
	Q := J\delta(t).
\end{equation}
A part of the physical meaning of the model is lost but this makes representations of the problem easier. $C$ now represents the two-dimensional density (i.e., in [$kg/m^2$]) of the tracer in water. $J$ can then be regarded as the mass of tracer released by the sudden point source at $\b x = \b x_1$. The three- and two-dimensional interpretations of the problem are represented on figure \ref{fig:testcase_scheme}.
% \footnote{This could be a bit confusing. As we switch from a 3-dimensional interpretation of the model to a 2-dimensional one, the meaning of the parameters changes. Hence, in the 3-dimensional interpretation, $C$ represents a 3D density ([$kg/m^3$]) and $M$ is a mass, whereas in the 2-dimensional interpretation, $C$ is a 2D density ([$kg/m^2$]) and $M$ has units of [$kg\,m$]. A part of the physical meaning of the model is lost, but this makes representations of the problem much easier.} \textcolor{red}{On peut aussi simplement considérer B = 1. Attention, si on opte finalement pour cette option, un facteur B doit être présent pour le calcul de certains diagnostiques.}

%------------------------------------PARAMETERS FOR TEST CASE 1--------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsubsection{Test case 1 : infinite domain}
The first (an most simple) test case consists in considering an infinite domain, i.e.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:testcase:domain}
	-\infty < y,\, z < \infty,
\end{equation}
with nonzero velocities $v$ and $w$. This test case provides a check that our numerical implementation handles the diffusion and advection processes properly both in the $y$- and $z$-directions. The parameters are chosen from the values proposed by \textit{C. Timmermans} for the overturner model in her master's thesis \cite{timmermans2006masterthesis}:
\begin{equation}
	v = \frac{\Psi}{H} = 4\e{-4}\mbox{ [$m/s$],}\quad  w = \frac{\Psi}{L}=1.33\e{-7}\mbox{ [$m/s$],}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
	K_{yy} = 10^{3} \mbox{ [$m^2/s$],}\quad K_{zz} = 10^{-4} \mbox{ [$m^2/s$].} 
\end{equation}
For the length scales of the overturner model, those diffusivities corresponds to Péclet numbers
\begin{equation}
	Pe_y = \frac{v}{K_{yy}/L} = 6,\quad Pe_z = \frac{w}{K_{zz}/H} = 6.67.
\end{equation}
Hence, in both the $y$- and $z$-directions, the transport is neither dominated by advection nor by diffusion. This is interesting as a test case since it allows to assess how the numerical solver handles both physical processes in both directions. 
Finally, $J = 10\,000$ particles are released at $t=0$ at the location $(y_1,z_1) = (0,0)$.

%------------------------------------PARAMETERS FOR TEST CASE 2--------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsubsection{Test case 2 : semi-infinite domain}
Another interesting case is to consider a semi-infinite domain with a wall at $z=0$ :
\begin{equation}
	-\infty < y < \infty,\quad 0 < z < \infty.
\end{equation}
This is useful to assess how our numerical model handles no-through boundary conditions. Again, the parameters values are related to the ones proposed in \textit{C. Timmermans}'s master's thesis for the overturner model :
\begin{equation}
	v = \frac{\Psi}{H} = 4\e{-4}\mbox{ [$m/s$],}\quad  w = 0\mbox{ [$m/s$],}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
	K_{yy} = 10^{3} \mbox{ [$m^2/s$],}\quad K_{zz} = 10^{-1} \mbox{ [$m^2/s$].} 
\end{equation}
Notice the choice  of $K_{zz}$ : it is chosen $10^3$ times larger than the value chosen for test case 1. The goal here is to assess that the boundary condition is well handled by the solver. Since $w=0$, only the vertical diffusivity could possibly drive the particles towards the wall. By increasing $K_{zz}$, we ensure that more particles will bounce against the wall, which is relevant in this context. $J = 10\,000$ particles are released at $t=0$ at the location $(y_1,z_1) = (0,H)$.

\subsection{Analytical solution and properties}
%------------------------------------------------Analytic GREEN's FUNCTION ---------------------------------------------%
\subsubsection{Green's function}
In order to build the analytical solution of the problem, we need to compute the Green's function associated to this particular problem. We derive the Green's function $G$ associated to test case 1. We will show later how this function can be used to compute the concentration for both test case 1 and test case 2. $\G$ is zero for $t<t'$ and is the solution of
\begin{equation} \label{eq:testcase_green}
	\begin{cases}
		\frac{\partial G}{\partial t} + v \frac{\partial G}{\partial y} + w\frac{\partial G}{\partial z} = K_{yy}\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial y^2} + K_{zz}\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial z^2}\\[.1cm]
		\left. G(y,z,t,t') \right \rvert_{t=t'} = \delta(y)\delta(z) 
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
for $t \ge 0$, and on an infinite domain $\infty < y,\, z < \infty$. It can be shown that
\begin{equation} 
	G(y,z,t,t') = \frac{\exp\left[-\frac{(y-s_v)^2}{4K_{yy}\tau} -\frac{(z-s_w)^2}{4K_{zz}\tau} \right]}{4\pi\sqrt{K_{yy}K_{zz}}\tau},
\end{equation}
where $\tau = t-t'$ and 
\begin{equation}
	\b s(t,t') = (s_v(t,t'), s_w(t,t')) = \left(\int_{t'}^{t}v \rm d \xi, \int_{t'}^{t}w \rm d \xi \right) = \left(v\tau, w\tau\right).
\end{equation}

$G$ has some interesting properties. The "mass" of the solution is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:testcase:propmass}
	m(t,t') \equiv \int_{\R[2]} \G \rm d \b x = 1.
\end{equation}
The "center of mass" is located at
\begin{equation} \label{eq:testcase:propcenter}
	\b r(t,t') \equiv \frac{1}{m(t,t')} \int_{\R[2]} \b x \G \rm d \b x  = \b s(t,t').
\end{equation}
The variance of the solution is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:testcase:propvar}
	\sigma^2(t,t') \equiv \frac{1}{m(t,t')} \int_{\R[2]} \lvert \b x - \b r(t,t') \rvert^2 \G \rm d \b x = 2 (K_{yy}+K_{zz}) \tau.
\end{equation}

%------------------------------------------------Analytic TEST CASE 1 ---------------------------------------------%
\subsubsection{Test case 1}
The analytical solution of test case 1 is now obtained with the help of the Green's function derived above by computing the convolution between $G$ and the source terms :
\begin{align}
	C(\b x,t) &= \int_{0}^{t} \int_{\R[2]} G(\b x - \b x',t,t') J \delta(t) \delta(\b x- \b x_1) \rm d \b{x}' \rm dt'\nonumber\\
	&= J G(\b x - \b x_1,t,0).
\end{align}
The concentration profile for test case 1 is thus
\begin{equation}
	C(y,z,t) = \frac{J}{4\pi\sqrt{K_{yy}K_{zz}}t}\exp\left[-\frac{(y-s_v)^2}{4K_{yy}t} -\frac{(z-s_w)^2}{4K_{zz}t} \right].
\end{equation}

The total mass of tracer present in the domain is
\begin{equation}
	m(t) \equiv \int_{\R[2]} C(\b x,t) \rm d \b x = J.
\end{equation}
Note that this number is independent of the transport processes.

The mass center is located at
\begin{align}
	\b r(t) &\equiv \frac{1}{m(t)} \int_{\R[2]} \b x C(\b x,t) \rm d \b x \nonumber \\
	&= \int_{\R[2]} \b x G(\b x - \b x_1,t,0) \rm d \b x \nonumber\\
	&= \int_{\R[2]} (\b x-\b x_1) G(\b x - \b x_1,t,0) + \b x_1 G(\b x - \b x_1,t,0) \rm d \b x\nonumber\\
	&= \b x_1 + \b s(t,0),
\end{align}
where properties \eqref{eq:testcase:propmass} and \eqref{eq:testcase:propcenter} are used to perform the last step.

Finally, the variance of the solution is
\begin{align}
	\sigma^2(t) &= \frac{1}{m(t)} \int_{\R[2]} \lvert \b x - \b r(t) \rvert^2 C(\b x,t) \rm d \b x \nonumber \\
	&= \int_{\R[2]} \lvert (\b x - \b x_1) - \b s(t,0)\rvert^2 G(\b x - \b x_1,t,0) \rm d \b x \nonumber \\
	&= 2(K_{yy}+K_{zz})t,
\end{align}
where property \eqref{eq:testcase:propvar} is used.

%------------------------------------------------Analytic TEST CASE 2 ---------------------------------------------%
\subsubsection{Test case 2}
To compute the solution to test case 2, a little trick must be applied. Consider the problem on an infinite domain with two sudden point sources of equal intensity located at $z = H$ and $z = -H$. By symmetry, one can see that the concentration of that problem in the region $[-\infty, \infty] \times [0, \infty]$ is precisely the concentration of test case 2. Hence, we can use the Green's function $G$ derived for test case 1 to compute the concentration. In this case, the convolution has to be performed with two point sources :
\begin{align}
	C(\b x,t) &= \int_{0}^{t} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} J \delta(t') \delta(y'- y_1)\left[\delta(z'-z_1)+\delta(z'+z_1)\right] G(y-y',z-z',t,t') \rm dy' \rm dz' \rm dt' \nonumber\\
	&= J \int_{0}^{t} \delta(t')[G(y-y_1,z-z_1,t,t')+G(y-y_1,z+z_1,t,t')] \label{tc2_eq2} \nonumber\\
	&= J[G(y-y_1,z-z_1,t,0)+G(y-y_1,z+z_1,t,0)].
\end{align}
The concentration of the tracer for test case 2 is thus
\begin{equation}
	C(y,z,t) = \frac{J}{4\pi\sqrt{K_{yy}K_{zz}}t}\exp\left[-\frac{(y-s_v)^2}{4K_{yy}t}\right]\left\{\exp\left[-\frac{(z-z_1)^2}{4K_{zz}t} \right] + \exp\left[-\frac{(z+z_1)^2}{4K_{zz}t} \right] \right\}
\end{equation}

The mass is obtained as
\begin{equation}
	m(t) \equiv \int_{0}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} C(y,z,t) \rm dy \rm dz = J,
\end{equation}
i.e. the number of particles released at $t=0$. This result is obvious since there is no other source or sink, and we impose a no-through condition at the boundary.

No analytic solution has been found for the center of mass and the variance. However, an accurate estimation of those quantities can be computed numerically from the expression of the concentration. 

% The mass center is
% \begin{align}
% 	\b r(t) &\equiv \frac{1}{m(t)} \int_{0}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (y \b e_y + z \b e_z) C(t,y,z) \rm dy \rm dz \nonumber \\
% 	&= \int_{0}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (y \b e_y + z \b e_z) \left[G(t,0,y-y_1,z-z_1)+G(t,0,y-y_1,z+z_1)\right] \rm dy \rm dz \nonumber\\
% 	&= \int_{\R[2]} (\b x-\b x_1) G(t,0,\b x - \b x_1) + \b x_1 G(t,0,\b x - \b x_1) \rm d \b x\nonumber\\
% 	&= \b x_1 + \b s(t,0),
% \end{align}

%-------------------------------------VALIDATION--------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\section{Validation of the numerical solver}
This section aims to show that the numerical results obtained with the solver are in good agreement with the analytical ones. As the combination of the two test cases cover the main features of the problems considered in this work, this constitutes a basic validation of the solver. 

Both test cases are simulated for 1 year with a time step of 1 hour, and $P = 10\,000$ particles are released at $t=0$.
The concentration is computed at the final time $T = 1$ year on the domain $\Omega = [y_{min},y_{max}] \times [z_{min},z_{max}]$, where the subscripts \textit{min} and \textit{max} stands for the minimal and maximal position at time $T$ amongst all the particles. The domain $\Omega$ is divided into $20 \times 20$ boxes denoted $\Omega_i$ for $i = 1,\dots,200$. Let $C_i(t)$ denote the concentration in box $i$ at time $t$ and $C_{max}(t) = \max_i C_i(t)$. The scaled concentration in box $i$ is computed as
\begin{equation}
	\tilde C_i(T) := \frac{C_i(T)}{C_{i,max}(T)} = \frac{P_i(T)}{P_{max}(T)},
\end{equation}
where $P_i(t)$ is the number of particles in box $i$ at time $t$ and $P_{max}(t) = \max_i P_i(t)$. The last equality is true because all the boxes have the same volume. The analytic solutions of the concentration are scaled identically:
\begin{equation}
	\tilde C(t) = \frac{C(t)}{C_{max}(t)}.
\end{equation}

%-------------------------------------RESULTS CASE 1----------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{Test case 1}
Figure \ref{fig:testcase_surf} shows a comparison between the numerical result and the analytical solution for the scaled concentration $C(\b x,T)/\tilde C$. Dark (resp. light) shaded areas correspond to zones where the numerically computed concentration is "above" (resp. "below") the exact concentration. It would probably have been more rigorous to represent the numerically computed concentration as a three-dimensional histogram since the box-counting method computes the mean value of the concentration in each box. However, here we have considered that the numerically computed mean concentration in a box corresponds to the concentration at the center of that box. The continuous representation of $\tilde{C}_{num}$ is then obtained by interpolation. Figures \ref{fig:testcase_fixedy} and \ref{fig:testcase_fixedz} represent respectively a cut of the concentrations at fixed $y = r_{y,exact}$ and at fixed $z = r_{z,exact}$. The numerically computed concentration $\tilde C_{num}$ seems to be an appreciable approximation of the exact concentration $\tilde C_{exact}$. To be more specific, the maximal local error is 
\begin{equation}
	\|\tilde C_{exact}- \tilde C_{num}\|_{\infty} = 7.017\e{-2}.
\end{equation}
The centers of mass are located at
\begin{equation}
	\b r_{exact} = (12\,614.4,\,4.2) \mbox{ [$m$],}\quad \b r_{num} = (11\,715.3,\,4.5) \mbox{ [$m$]}.
\end{equation}
The relative error is
\begin{equation}
	\b e_r = \left \lvert \frac{\b r_{exact}-\b r_{num}}{\b r_{exact}} \right \rvert =  \left(7.13\e{-2}, 7.89\e{-2}\right),
\end{equation}
where the division is taken element-wise on the vectors. The euclidean norm of the relative error is
\begin{equation}
	\| \b e_r \|_2 = 1.06\e{-1}.
\end{equation}
This can be seen as a quantification of the error on advection. To quantify the error on diffusion, we compute the variance of the concentration :
\begin{equation}
	\sigma^2_{exact} = 6.31\e{10} \mbox{ [$m^2$],}\quad \sigma^2_{num} = 6.43\e{10} \mbox{ [$m^2$].}
\end{equation}
The relative error is
\begin{equation}
	e_{\sigma^2} = \left \lvert \frac{\sigma^2_{exact}-\sigma^2_{num}}{\sigma^2_{exact}}\right \rvert = 1.86\e{-2}.
\end{equation}

%-------------------------------------------RESULTS CASE 2-----------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{Test case 2}
Figure \ref{fig:testcaseSI_surf} shows a comparison between the numerical result and the analytical solution for the scaled concentrations for test case 2. The same remark as the one made for test case 1 applies concerning the representation of the numerically computed concentration. Since we do not have analytical expressions of the center of mass and of the variance for this test case, the "exact" values are approximated numerically thanks to the analytical expression of the concentration. Figures \ref{fig:testcaseSI_fixedy} and \ref{fig:testcaseSI_fixedz} represent respectively a cut of the concentrations at fixed $y = r_{y,exact}$ and along the boundary $z = 0$. The big picture about test case 2 is the presence of a boundary with no-through condition. A first verification is to check if all the particles are still in the domain, which is indeed the case. Although this might seem trivial here, it is sometimes a real challenge to ensure that no particle crosses the boundary, especially for geometrically complex domains. Besides, one can see on figure \ref{fig:testcaseSI_fixedz} that the concentration profile is well approximated along the boundary. Indeed, the maximal local error at the boundary is
\begin{equation}
	\|\tilde C_{exact}(y,0)- \tilde C_{num}(y,0)\|_{\infty} = 2.964\e{-2}, 
\end{equation}
The maximal local error on the whole domain is 
\begin{equation}
	\|\tilde C_{exact}- \tilde C_{num}\|_{\infty} = 8.668\e{-2}.
\end{equation}
The centers of mass are located at
\begin{equation}
	\b r_{exact} = (1.26\e{4},5.06\e{3}) \mbox{ [$m$],}\quad \b r_{num} = (1.37\e{4},5.05\e{3}) \mbox{ [$m$]}.
\end{equation}
The relative error is
\begin{equation}
	\b e_r = \left \lvert \frac{\b r_{exact}-\b r_{num}}{\b r_{exact}} \right \rvert =  \left(8.566\e{-2}, 2.718\e{-3}\right).
\end{equation}
The euclidean norm of the relative error is
\begin{equation}
	\| \b e_r \|_2 = 8.571\e{-2}.
\end{equation}
This can be seen as a quantification of the error on advection. To quantify the error on diffusion, we compute the variance of the concentration :
\begin{equation}
	\sigma^2_{exact} = 6.39\e{10} \mbox{ [$m^2$],}\quad \sigma^2_{num} = 6.25\e{10} \mbox{ [$m^2$].}
\end{equation}
The relative error is
\begin{equation}
	e_{\sigma^2} = \left \lvert \frac{\sigma^2_{exact}-\sigma^2_{num}}{\sigma^2_{exact}}\right \rvert = 2.269\e{-2}.
