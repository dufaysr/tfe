\chapter{From clusters to compartments} \label{chap:method}
The goal now is to use a clustering algorithm on an advection-diffusion problem, and ultimately use the partitions to build a box-model. The underpinning idea is that communities found on the dynamic of the flow could be relevant compartments for the box-model. The idea makes sense although it is far from being obvious that the communities are indeed the compartments that we seek. In a first instance, we should only check that, at least in some cases, community detection leads to relevant partitions. Hence, we first build a test problem for which we know in advances what compartments to expect. Then we apply the method on the less obvious, though still very naive overturner model of the Atlantic ocean.

\paragraph{Remark} \label{remark:straightboundaries} In the context of interpreting the communities as compartments for a box-model, we should require that the communities have vertical and horizontal boundaries. When dealing with marine problems, the goal of a box-model is to provide a simple and intuitive description of the problem. Complex shaped compartments are neither simple nor intuitive for marine models, hence the requirement.
