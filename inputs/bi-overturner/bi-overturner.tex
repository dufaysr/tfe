\chapter{Application: the bi-overturner problem} \label{chap:bioverturner}
This section can be considered as a kind of \textit{sanity check} of the method: we define a class of problems, the \textit{bi-overturner} problems, for which the box decomposition is intuitively obvious and we check that a community detection algorithm applied on the problem allows to find back that box-decomposition. Then, compartment models are build and their validity is discussed.
