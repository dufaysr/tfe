\chapter{Structure of a compartment model for tracer transport} \label{chap:compartment}
% The previous chapters cover the material needed to derive compartments from the dynamics of a tracer transport model. But deciding which subdomains define the compartments is only the first step in building a compartment model. 
A relevant compartment model should reproduce the properties covered in section~\ref{sec:propcontinuous} for the corresponding continuous model. In this chapter, a compartment model structure that fulfills that requirement is proposed, and the corresponding matrix form is derived. This chapter is widely inspired from \cite{deleersnijder2014compartment} and \cite{delhez2010compartment}.
