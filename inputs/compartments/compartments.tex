\chapter{Structure of a compartment model for tracer transport} \label{chap:compartment}
The previous chapters cover the material needed to derive compartments from the dynamics of a tracer transport model. But deciding which subdomains define the compartments is only the first step in building a compartment model. In this chapter, the structure of a compartment model is reviewed. Obviously, the compartment model has to share some of the properties of the corresponding continuous model, and covered in \textcolor{red}{chapter ?? of this work}. In this chapter, it is seen how to express a compartment model in matrix form and the matrix formulation is derived. This chapter is widely inspired from \cite{deleersnijder2014compartment} and \cite{delhez2010compartment}.
