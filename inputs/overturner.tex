\chapter{The "overturner" model}
We developp here the idealized representation of the meridian circulation in the Atlantic ocean that will be studied in the next chapters. \textcolor{red}{ici : développement mathématique. Plus loin on donne des valeurs aux paramètres avec un "physical insight"}. We consider a rectangular domain in the $(y,z)$-coordinate system. The coordinate $y$ is associated to the latitude with $\hat{\b{e}}_y$ pointing towards the North, and $z$ is associated to the depth with $\hat{\b{e}}_z$ pointing upwards. The domain is delimited by
\begin{equation}
	0 \le y \le L,\quad 0 \le z \le H,
\end{equation}
where $L$ and $H$ are positive constants. The ocean surface is thus located at $z = H$ while $z = 0$ stands for the deep-ocean. The South and North boundaries are respectively given by $y = 0$ and $y = L$. We aim at defining a stationnary velocity field $\b u(y,z) = (u(y,z),\, w(y,z))$
