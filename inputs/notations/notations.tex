\section*{List of Symbols}
Unless otherwise stated, bold lower cases indicate column vectors ($\b x$) and bold upper cases indicate matrices ($\b X$). The entries of a vector are denoted by a single subscript ($x_i$) and the entries of a matrix are denoted by brackets with a double subscript ($[\b X]_{i,j})$. The transposed sign is $^\t$.

\noindent As a general rule, subscript $t$ indicates a discrete-time quantity evaluated at time $t$, while parenthesis indicate a continuous-time quantity.

\noindent The time derivative of a quantity $x$ is denoted by the usual convention $\partial x/\partial t$, or by $\dot{x}$.
